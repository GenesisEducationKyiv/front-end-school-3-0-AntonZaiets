# ADR 0002: Improving maintainability and scalability through tooling and structure



## Context

The current codebase lacks important development and testing infrastructure:

- No centralized UI-kit for reusable components.

- No CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

- No Storybook setup for component isolation and documentation.

- No unit tests in place.

These limitations make the system harder to scale and maintain as it grows.



## Decision

To improve maintainability and scalability, I propose:

- Extract all reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, modals, etc.) into components/ui/.

- Write unit tests using Vite-Test.

- Set up Storybook for isolated component development and documentation.

- Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD: run linting and tests on pull requests.



## Rationale

Adding a design system and tooling infrastructure will improve collaboration, reduce bugs, and prepare the project for long-term growth.



## Status
Proposed



## Consequences

### Positive:

- Easier reuse of components.

- Faster development cycles.

- Fewer bugs and regressions.

- Better documentation for developers.



### Negative:

- Initial setup effort.

- Slight increase in project complexity.

- Onboarding required for team members unfamiliar with the tools.
