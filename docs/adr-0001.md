# ADR 0001: Improving usability through a unified design system



## Context

The project supports core functionality like adding, editing, deleting, sorting, and playing audio tracks. However, the user experience is lacking in several areas:

- The UI lacks a clear visual hierarchy.

- There is no visual feedback after user actions.

- There is no audio feedback for people with visual impairments.

- The interface is not responsive well on mobile devices.

- Users cannot toggle between light and dark themes.

- The app lacks localization (i18n), limiting it to one language.

These issues reduce intuitiveness and accessibility, especially for new users.



## Decision

To improve usability, I propose the following changes:

- Add toast notifications for success and failure (e.g., react-hot-toast, notistack).

- Enable inline editing of track properties (e.g., title, genre) without modals.

- Improve responsive design using media queries or utility-first frameworks.

- Improve accessibility (screen reader support, ARIA labels, etc.).

- Implement light/dark theme toggling using Tailwind configuration.

- Integrate react-i18next to support multiple languages (e.g., English and Ukrainian).



## Rationale

Enhancing usability will make the app more intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable to use, attracting a wider user base.



## Status
Proposed



## Consequences

### Positive:

- Better user satisfaction.

- Broader accessibility and mobile support.

- A more polished and modern interface.



### Negative:

- Additional development and testing effort.
